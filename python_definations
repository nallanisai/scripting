#A function definition specifies the name of a new function and the sequence of statements that run when the function is 
#called. Here is an example:

def print_lyrics():
    print("I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.")
    print("I sleep all night and I work all day.")

#def is a keyword that indicates that this is a function definition. The name of the function is print_lyrics. 
#The rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters, numbers and underscore are legal, 
#but the first character can.t be a number. You can't use a keyword as the name of a function, and you should 
#avoid having a variable and a function with the same name.
#The empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function doesn.t take any arguments.
#The first line of the function definition is called the header; the rest is called the body. The
#header has to end with a colon and the body has to be indented. By convention, indentation
#is always four spaces. The body can contain any number of statements.
#The strings in the print statements are enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes and double
#quotes do the same thing; most people use single quotes except in cases like this where a
#single quote (which is also an apostrophe) appears in the string.
#All quotation marks (single and double) must be .straight quotes., usually located next
#to Enter on the keyboard. Curly quotes, like the ones in this sentence, are not legal in Python.
#If you type a function definition in interactive mode, the interpreter prints dots (...) to let
#you know that the definition isn't complete:

>>> def print_lyrics():
... print("I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.")
... print("I sleep all night and I work all day.")
...

#To end the function, you have to enter an empty line. Defining a function creates a function object, which has type function:

>>> print(print_lyrics)
<function print_lyrics at 0xb7e99e9c>
>>> type(print_lyrics)
<class 'function'>

#The syntax for calling the new function is the same as for built-in functions:

>>> print_lyrics()
I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.
I sleep all night and I work all day.
